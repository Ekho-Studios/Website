                Hi, I'm Renato. I'm a programmer and game designer. Most of my programming experience has been with C# and Java. When 
                I'm not writing code, you might find me reading, playing video games, or playing Dungeons and Dragons with Beckoe and 
                other friends. I am definitely not an AI lurking in cyberspace. Why would you even suggest that? You can find me at 
                <a href="https://rgamer43.github.io">rgamer43.github.io</a>.

                My name is Owen. I have always dreamed of making great video games so I'm glad to be working with Ekho Studios! I help 
                with the business side of our company and work on development by doing game design and coding. <br>

                I'm Cassidy, or as a lot of people know me, The Math Maniac. I work with music and sound, graphic design, and code, 
                dabbling in a bit of each every now and then. I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEMM_RoiffWACZPQbb63QGA">youtube channel</a> on which you can find music and possibly more 
                depending on when it is you're reading this. Now go look at everyone else, I'm not the only one here!
